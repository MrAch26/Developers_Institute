LIST AND STRINGS:
name = "jonathan"
name[0] // "j"
name[-1] // "n"

{slice}
name[0:3] // "jon" 
name[4:7] // "tha"
name[2:] // "nathan" (if you don't specify start will start at beginning. Same with end if you don't specify it.)
name[0:8:2] or name [::2]// "jnta" (getting every other one)
name[::-1]// name backwards

(only for lists) 
names["joe", "anne", "don"]
othernames ["mike", "bob", "sara"]
names.append("fred")// adds fred to the end
names.remove("anna")// removes anne (the value).
names.pop()// removes last item
names.pop(1)// removes item at position 1
popped = names.pop(0)// storing the popped item
all_names = names + other names// adds the two lists
names.append(othernames)// puts othernames in list inside names.
names[3][1]// returns bob
sorted(name of list) sorts it
len(name of list) gives length
names.index(20)// searches lists for first thing with the value is 20 
names.count("joe")//will count how many times joe shows up in the list.
 

string is immutable//can't cange it
lists are mutable// the stuff in it


SETS:
set1 = {"a","b","c"}
set.add("d")// adds
(Sets are not ordered and therefore not indexable,does not allow duplicates)


TUPLES: (are like immutable lists, are  indexed.)
tup = (1,2,3)
Useful for things that don't change, like days of the week.

DICTIONARIES: (No matter how big they are, they do operations instantly. (Unlike a list))




Homework:

#how to add in the middle of list?
#how to add in the left?
