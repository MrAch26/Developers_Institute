##Rules :
- **You have until tonight at 11:59pm** to submit your challenge (using your Github account ).
- You will have to submit the link to the **#daily_challenge** Slack group with the following message:  *Daily_challenge - URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY"* .
- Submissions not following the above rules will not be taken into account and you don't earn your XP.
- Everyday, before starting the course, each one of you will present his daily challenge !

##Good to know :
- Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, slack, programming buddy etc...) but your instructor will not be offering any help with this daily challenge. Just like a developer you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own!


##One Last Thing!
**Good luck!
